# Insurance Predictor App

Welcome to the Insurance Predictor App! This application leverages a simple supervised machine learning model (LASSO) to predict insurance charges based on user input. It's designed with Streamlit, making it user-friendly and easy to interact with.

## Project Overview

The Insurance Predictor App uses historical insurance data to train a supervised machine learning model. The model learns to predict insurance charges based on features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to provide users with an estimate of their insurance costs based on their input parameters.

## Getting Started

To run the Insurance Predictor App on your local machine, you'll need to have Python and Streamlit installed. If you haven't installed Streamlit yet, you can do so using pip:

```sh
pip install streamlit
